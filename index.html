<p> Popularized by Japan, matcha is essentially finely grained green tea powder. Though it originaled in China, its largely used in Japanese culture in tea ceremonies. Often times, many consider green tea and matcha to be the same things, considering they're from the same source.
  Yet, they're different in terms of taste and extense of health benefits. Matcha entails to use the entirety of the green tea leaves where all the nutrients are stored. 
Its well known vibrant color roots from the increased production of chorophyll when leaving harvested leaves out to dry. The common rule of thumb when
acquiring matcha is seeing how vibrant its shade of green is. The brighter and more intense green matcha is means its of higher quality or ceremonial grade. This means when whisking the powder, you'd expect a
  smoother, subtle sweetness from the matcha. However, if the powder is dull in color or yellowish, this means more mature leaves have been grounded to make a more astringant flavored low-grade quality matcha. 
Obviously, to each their own when it comes to what taste you find the yummiest and become most accostumed to when drinking matcha, but if you're a beginner
I'd argue that start with mid-grade matcha is best. This type hits just the sweet spot in terms of sweeetness and bitterness from the tea. Tasting such balance helps you decide whether you prefer one or the other, or even even enjoy both to acquire a sense of that umami taste. </p>
