<p> Popularized by Japan, matcha is essentially finely grained green tea powder. Though it originaled in China, its largely used in Japanese culture in tea ceremonies. Often times, many consider green tea and matcha to be the same things, considering they're from the same source.
  Yet, they're different in terms of taste and extense of health benefits. Matcha entails to use the entirety of the green tea leaves where all the nutrients are stored. 
Its well known vibrant color roots from the increased production of chorophyll when leaving harvested leaves out to dry. The common rule of thumb when
acquiring matcha is seeing how vibrant its shade of green is. The brighter and more intense green matcha is means its of higher quality or ceremonial grade. This means when whisking the powder, you'd expect a
  smoother, subtle sweetness from the matcha. However, if the powder is dull in color or yellowish, this means more mature leaves have been grounded to make a more astringant flavored low-grade quality matcha. 
Obviously, to each their own when it comes to what taste you find the yummiest and become most accostumed to when drinking matcha, but if you're a beginner
I'd argue that start with mid-grade matcha is best. This type hits just the sweet spot in terms of sweeetness and bitterness from the tea. Tasting such balance helps you decide whether you prefer one or the other, or even even enjoy both to acquire a sense of that umami taste. </p>

<h2> Step by step process to making Matcha Latte  </h2>

  <h4>
  <p> Needed Materials: </p>  </h4>
  <h5>
    <p> 1. Matcha Powder</p>
    <p>  2. Matcha Whisk</p>
 <p>   3. Wide brimed bowl  </p>
    <p> 4. sifter    </p>
 <p>  5. Hot water   </p>
 <p>  6. Milk of your choice (Soy milk, whole milk, oat milk, etc.)   </p>
 <p>   7. Optional* sweetner (flavored syrups)  </p>
    <p></p>
  </h5>

 <p> 1. Atleast 30 minutes before making matcha, soak matcha whisk in a cup of hot water to bloom.     </p>
 <p>  (this is due to the material of the matcha whisk, bamboo)   </p>
 <p> 2. Once the whisk is ready, start by measuring 1-2 half teaspoons of your choice of matcha powder to sift into bowl.    </p>
<p> 3. Use a small amount of hot water into powder (I personally just eyeball it to maybe be about 1/4 of a cup)    </p>
  <p> 4. Time to whisk! When whisking, make sure to create "m" or "z" motions when whisking to get rid of any chalkyness in the powder to create the perfect smoothness of whisked matcha    </p>
  <p> *Have a glass of ice prepared for the sake of serving, but following steps works too in the bowl, just add ice*    </p>
  <p> 5. This is optional, but in your bowl or glass you'd drink out off, add sweetner of choice;    </p>
  <p>  Into the mixture, I personally like a few pumps of vanilla syrup, or some maple syrup   </p>
<p> 6. Then add your choice of milk after    </p>
  <p> 7. Time to pour in frothy matcha into the milk, then....</p>
  <p>  Voila! Time to drink, grab a straw mix the matcha and milk together, and enjoy your delicious matcha iced latte.   </p>

  <p> If you'd want a hot version of this latte, simply don't add ice and warm up + froth your milk      </p>
